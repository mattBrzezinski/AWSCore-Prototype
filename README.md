## AWSCore-Prototype

This project is for prototyping ideas for [AWSCore.jl v2.0](https://github.com/JuliaCloud/AWSCore.jl).
We need to prototype ideas for both high and low level API wrappers.

## Usage

Currently testing with AWS S3, you need to create a bucket and place a few items into them.

### High Level
- Prototype-1
  - `cd src/High-Level-Wrapper-Prototypes/Prototype-1/`
  - `julia AWSCorePrototype.jl`
  
### Low Level
- Prototype-1
  - `cd src/Low-Level-Wrapper-Prototypes/Prototype-1/`
  - `julia low_level_wrapper.jl`
